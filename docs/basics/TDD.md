# 1.1 TDD Workflow
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology that involves writing tests for a piece of code before writing the code itself. The workflow for TDD typically involves the following steps:

- Write a test: Start by writing a test that defines the expected behavior of the code you want to write. This test should fail because the code does not yet exist.

- Run the test: Run the test to confirm that it fails as expected.

- Write the code: Write the minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass.

- Run the tests: Run all the tests, including the one you just wrote, to ensure that the code you wrote works as intended and does not break any existing functionality.

- Refactor the code: If necessary, clean up and optimize the code you just wrote without changing its functionality.

- Repeat: Continue the cycle by writing more tests and writing the code to make them pass.

Using TDD can help you catch bugs early in the development process, ensure that your code is well-designed and maintainable, and improve the overall quality of your software. It's important to note that TDD is just one approach to software development and may not be suitable for every project.
