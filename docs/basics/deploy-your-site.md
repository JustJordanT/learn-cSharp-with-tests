# 1.1 Types

`C#` is a type-safe, object-oriented programming language that is widely used for building a range of applications, including web, mobile, desktop, and games. `C#` has a rich set of data types that you can use to store and manipulate data in your program.

In `C#`, there are two main categories of data types: value types and reference types.

## Value types include:

**Integral types**: sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong

**Floating-point types**: float and double

**Decimal type**: decimal

**Boolean type**: bool

**Character type**: char

**Reference types include**:

- String type: string
- Object type: object
- Dynamic type: dynamic

`C#` also has a special type called var, which allows you to declare a variable without specifying its type. The type of the variable will be inferred from the expression used to initialize it.

For example:

```csharp
int x = 10;          // x is of type int
double y = 10.5;     // y is of type double
string s = "Hello";  // s is of type string
var z = 10;          // z is of type int
```
It's important to choose the right data type for your variables, as it determines how much memory the variable will consume and how the value will be stored and manipulated in your program.

I hope this gives you a good introduction to `C#` data types.
