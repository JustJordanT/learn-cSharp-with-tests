# 1.0 Getting started with "C#"

Installing `C#` on your local machine.

`C#` (pronounced "C sharp") is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to use, modern, and powerful. `C#` is widely used for building a variety of applications, including desktop applications, mobile apps, and web apps.

.NET is a software framework developed by Microsoft that provides a runtime environment and a set of libraries for building and running applications. It supports multiple programming languages, including `C#`.

In other words, `C#` is a programming language and `.NET` is a software framework that you can use to build applications. You can use `C#` to write the code for your application, and .NET provides the tools and infrastructure you need to build, run, and deploy the application.

While `C#` and .NET are often used together, they are not the same thing. You can use `C#` with other frameworks, and you can use other programming languages with .NET.

As of December 2022, the LTS for `.NET` is 6.0 click on the following link to install .NET on your local machine.

`C#` is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to be easy to use, powerful, and flexible. Here are some of the key features of `C#` syntax:

- **Types**: `C#` has a variety of built-in types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, as well as support for user-defined types.

- **Variables**: `C#` uses variables to store values in memory. Variables have a type, which determines the kind of data they can store, and a name, which allows you to refer to them in your code.

- **Expressions and operators**: `C#` supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators, that you can use to build expressions.

- **Control structures**: `C#` provides various control structures, such as if-else statements, for loops, and while loops, that allow you to control the flow of your code.

- **Functions**: `C#` supports the use of functions, which are blocks of code that can be called by name. Functions can take parameters and return a value.

- **Classes and objects**: `C#` is an object-oriented language, which means it allows you to define classes and create objects based on those classes. A class is a template that defines the properties and behaviors of an object, and an object is an instance of a class.

- **Interfaces**: `C#` allows you to define interfaces, which are collections of related methods that a class can implement. An interface specifies the behavior of an object, but not the implementation.

These are just a few of the key features of `C#` syntax. There are many other aspects of `C#` syntax, such as namespaces, exceptions, and attributes, that you can learn about as you continue to work with the language.
