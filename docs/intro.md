# Learning C# With Test

### Learn test-driven development with C#
- Explore the Go language by writing tests
- Get a grounding with TDD. C# is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in
- Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in C#

# Test-driven development (TDD)

Is a software development approach in which you write tests for a piece of code before writing the code itself. The goal of TDD is to ensure that your code is correct and meets the requirements specified by the tests.

To use TDD with C#, you will need to use a testing framework. There are several options available, including `NUnit` and `xUnit`. Once you have chosen a testing framework, you can follow these steps to practice TDD in C#:

1. Write a test that defines the desired behavior of the code you are about to write. This test should fail initially, because you have not yet written the code that it is testing.

2. Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass.

3. Run the test to ensure that it passes.

4. Refactor the code as needed to improve its design and maintainability, without changing its behavior.

- Repeat the process for the next piece of functionality.

By following this process, you can ensure that your code is correct and meets the requirements specified by the tests, and you can catch and fix any issues early in the development process.

Happy coding, my friends! üèó
